Protein Digestion Simulator Change Log

Version 2.1.2481; October 17, 2006
	- Now including a header line when converting a .Fasta file to a text file
		- If "Look for addnl Ref in description" is enabled, then includes each of the accession names in the header line
		- When writing out the accession numbers, no longer includes the accession name in each data line, since the header line contains that information
	- Fixed a parsing bug that caused proteins with descriptions like the following to throw an error when splitting on | and : to find addnl Refs in protein descriptions
		- Tax_Id=9606 PREDICTED: hypothetical
	- Updated to new version of NETPrediction.dll (v 1.0.2481)

Version 2.1.2419; August 16, 2006
	- Added the ability to create multiple scrambled fasta files for a given input file using the Protein Scrambling Loop Count option
	- Fixed loading of options from a parameter file specified at the command line

Version 2.1.2379; July 7, 2006
	- Added option to filter digested peptides by pI

Version 2.1.2369; June 27, 2006
	- Added enzyme LysC, which cleaves after K
		- See http://ca.expasy.org/tools/peptidecutter/peptidecutter_enzymes.html

Version 2.1.2091.33214; September 22, 2005
	- Now using the name Basic version instead of Lite version for the version that does not contain the Kangas prediction algorithm

Version 2.1.2090.22113; September 21, 2005
	- Updated to use new NETPrediction DLL
	- Added Help->About NET Prediction menu item
		- Displays information about the algorithm's developers, including a journal reference or website with additional information

Version 2.1.2082.22601; September 13, 2005
	- Updated to use SharedVBNetRoutines.dll instead of clsSharedADONetFunctions.vb and clsSharedVBNetFunctions.vb

Version 2.1.2064.27890; August 26, 2005
	- Added option to compute pI and hydrophobicity of proteins and peptides
		- Code provided by Gordon Anderson from ICR-2LS
		- There are 6 available hydrophobicity modes
	- GUI includes an interactive textbox where a peptide sequence can be pasted and the pI and hydrophobicity computed

Version 2.1.2056.27567; August 18, 2005
	- Updated to new version of ValidateFastaFile.dll; includes rule to check for escape characters in the protein description

Version 2.1.2053.31162; August 15, 2005
	- Updated the formula and mass of residues J and X to be the same as Leucine or Isoleucine (C6H11NO: 113.08 Da)
		- Previously, J and X had the same formula and mass as Lysine (C6H12N2O: 128.09)

Version 2.1.2049.28765; August 11, 2005
	- Fixed bug that caused the program to crash if an invalid file fasta path was present and the user clicked Validate Fasta File
	- Updated to a new version of ValidateFastaFile.dll which uses a VB.NET interface to define the functions and properties
	- Updated to a new version of SharedVBNetRoutines.dll

Version 2.1.2008.27908; June 30, 2005
 	- Updated to use new ValidateFastaFile.dll which implements user-editable RegEx-based definitions for the validation rules

Version 2.1.1992; June 15, 2005
	- Updated to use new NETPrediction DLL with 1052 node prediction model

May 6, 2005
	- Added option to identify matching peaks (for uniqueness calculations) using a simple Ellipse search range rather than SLiC score

May 2, 2005
	- Added Fasta file validation option (utilizing ValidateFastaFile.dll)

January 26, 2005
	- Abandoned storing data in the Sql Server database since inefficient

January 18, 2005
	- Redesigned feature info, peptide info, and protein info classes to optionally store data in a Sql Server Database, thereby allowing signficant decreases in memory consumption (at the cost of execution speed)

December 17, 2004
	- Added option to write out a percentage of the residues from reversed protein sequences

December 3, 2004
	- Added option to output data as new fasta file; added saving/loading addition info from Xml settings file.

November 22, 2004
	- Switched to writing results by threshold as they are computed to decrease memory usage

November 21, 2004
